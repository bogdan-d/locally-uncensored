## v2.0 — What's New

**Security Hardening**
- SSRF protection on all external fetches (private IP/scheme blocking)
- Memory content sanitization prevents prompt injection via stored memories
- Workflow recursion guard (max depth 5) and loop hard cap (max 100 iterations)
- localStorage quota protection with automatic cleanup prevents data loss
- API key storage disclaimer for cloud providers

**New Features**
- **Regenerate / Edit Messages** — Edit any user message and resend, or regenerate any AI response
- **Memory Debug Panel** — See which memories are injected into the current prompt
- **Rate-limited Auto-Extraction** — Memory extraction every 3rd turn with short-response skip, cost warnings for cloud providers

**UI Improvements**
- A/B Compare and Benchmark accessible from the main header navigation
- Homepage quick-action buttons for Compare Models and Benchmark
- ErrorBoundary wrapping around all main views prevents white-screen crashes

## ❓ Why Locally Uncensored?

Tired of switching between Ollama for chat, ComfyUI for images, and another tool for video? Frustrated with bloated UIs that need Docker and a PhD to set up?

**Locally Uncensored** is the all-in-one solution. One app. One setup. Everything local.

## ✨ Features

- **Uncensored AI Chat** — Run abliterated models locally with zero restrictions
- **Multi-Provider Support** — Ollama (local), OpenAI-compatible (OpenRouter, Groq, LMStudio, vLLM), Anthropic (Claude). Switch providers per conversation.
- **Agent Mode (Beta)** — Give your AI tools: web search, web fetch, file I/O, code execution, image generation. It chains tools autonomously to answer questions with real data. Best with [Hermes 3](https://ollama.com/library/hermes3).
- **Model A/B Compare** — Send the same prompt to two models side by side. Compare speed, quality, and token usage in real-time with parallel streaming.
- **Local Benchmark** — One-click benchmark any model on your hardware. Measures tokens/sec, time-to-first-token. Leaderboard across all tested models.
- **Memory System** — The AI remembers you across conversations. Context-aware injection scales with model size. Auto-extraction learns from every exchange. Export/import as .md or .json.
- **Agent Workflows** — Reusable multi-step agent chains. 3 built-in workflows (Research Topic, Summarize URL, Code Review). Visual builder for custom workflows with prompt, tool, condition, and loop steps.
- **Image Generation** — Text-to-image via ComfyUI with full parameter control
- **Video Generation** — Text-to-video with Wan 2.1/2.2, HunyuanVideo, LTX support
- **Document Chat (RAG)** — Upload PDFs, DOCX, or TXT files and chat with your documents
- **Voice Chat** — Talk to your AI with push-to-talk and hear responses with TTS
- **LaTeX / Math Rendering** — Full KaTeX support for inline and block math equations
- **Chat Export** — Export conversations as Markdown or JSON with one click
- **Token Counter** — Live token usage display with color-coded progress bar
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** — Ctrl+N (new chat), Ctrl+E (export), Ctrl+L (focus input), Ctrl+/ (shortcuts)
- **Search Providers** — Agent web search via SearXNG, Brave Search, Tavily, or DuckDuckGo. Configurable in settings.
- **25+ Personas** — From Helpful Assistant to Roast Master, switchable via dropdown
- **Model Manager** — Browse uncensored + mainstream models. HOT/AGENT badges. Variant selector for multi-size downloads.
- **Thinking Display** — See the AI's reasoning in collapsible blocks
- **Linear/Arc UI** — Compact, monochrome, collapsible settings. Premium feel.
- **Privacy First** — Zero tracking. All API calls proxied locally. No analytics.
- **100% Local** — Everything runs on your machine (cloud providers optional)
- **Standalone Desktop App** — Tauri v2 Rust backend. Download the .exe, run it.

## Tech Stack

- **Desktop**: Tauri v2 (Rust backend, standalone .exe — no Node.js required)
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, Framer Motion
- **State**: Zustand with localStorage persistence

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Windows

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored.git
cd locally-uncensored
setup.bat
```

### Linux / macOS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored.git
cd locally-uncensored
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

The setup script automatically:
1. Checks for Node.js 18+, Git, and Ollama
2. Installs missing dependencies
3. Downloads a recommended uncensored AI model (~5.7 GB)
4. Starts the app in your browser

### Manual Installation

**Prerequisites:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+, [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored.git
cd locally-uncensored
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** — the app recommends models on first launch.

### Image & Video Generation

No separate installation needed! When you open the **Create** tab:

1. The app checks for ComfyUI automatically
2. If not found, click **"Install ComfyUI Automatically"** — it clones, installs dependencies, and sets up CUDA in one click
3. Go to **Model Manager → Discover → Image/Video** and click **Install All** on any model bundle
4. Generate images and videos — everything is ready

The entire setup happens inside the app. No terminal commands, no manual config files.

### One-Click Start (Windows)

```batch
start.bat
```

Launches Ollama + ComfyUI + the app in one go.

## 📦 Portable / No-Install

**Don't want to install anything?** Download the portable version — just extract and run. No admin rights, no installer, no registry entries.

### Windows (Portable)
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored/releases)
2. Download the `.exe` installer
3. When the installer opens, select **"Install for current user only (portable)"**
4. Choose any folder (e.g., a USB drive) — done!

Alternatively, download the `.msi` for a traditional system-wide install.

### Linux (Portable)
1. Download the `.AppImage` from [Releases](https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored/releases)
2. `chmod +x Locally-Uncensored_*.AppImage`
3. `./Locally-Uncensored_*.AppImage`

No installation needed — AppImage is portable by design.

### macOS (Portable)
1. Download the `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored/releases)
2. Drag to any folder (doesn't have to be Applications)
3. Right-click → Open (first time only, to bypass Gatekeeper)

> **Note:** You still need [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed for AI chat. The app will guide you through setup on first launch.

## 🧠 Model Auto-Detection

The app automatically detects all installed models across all backends — no manual configuration needed:

- **Text models** — Auto-detected from Ollama. On first launch, the app scans your hardware and recommends the best uncensored models for your system.
- **Image models** — Auto-detected from ComfyUI's `models/checkpoints` folder. Drop any checkpoint in there and it shows up instantly.
- **Video models** — Auto-detected from ComfyUI. The app identifies your video backend (Wan 2.1/2.2 or AnimateDiff) and lists available models automatically.

Just install models in the standard locations and the app picks them up.
