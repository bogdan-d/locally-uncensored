- **AI Backend**: Ollama (text), ComfyUI (images/video)
- **Build**: Vite 8

## Quick Start

### One-Command Setup (Windows)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored.git
cd locally-uncensored
setup.bat
```

That's it. The setup script automatically:
1. Installs Node.js, Git, and Ollama (if missing)
2. Installs all dependencies
3. Downloads a recommended uncensored AI model (~5.7 GB)
4. Creates a desktop shortcut
5. Starts the app in your browser

### Manual Installation

**Prerequisites:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+, [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored.git
cd locally-uncensored
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** — the app recommends models on first launch.

### Image/Video Generation (Optional)

1. Install [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   COMFYUI_PATH=C:\path\to\your\ComfyUI
   ```
3. Click **Start ComfyUI** in the Create tab, or start it manually
4. Download image models (e.g., SDXL checkpoints) into ComfyUI's `models/checkpoints` folder

### One-Click Start (Windows)

Use `start.bat` to launch everything together:
```batch
start.bat
```

| AnimateDiff v3 + SD1.5 | 6-8 GB | MP4 | Requires AnimateDiff custom nodes |

**Wan setup:** Place models in ComfyUI's `models/diffusion_models/`, `models/text_encoders/`, and `models/vae/` folders.

**AnimateDiff setup:** Install [ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved](https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved) and [ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite](https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite) via ComfyUI Manager.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file (see `.env.example`):

```env
# Path to your ComfyUI installation (optional)
COMFYUI_PATH=C:\path\to\your\ComfyUI
```
