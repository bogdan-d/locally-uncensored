## v2.3.6 — Current Release

**Remote ComfyUI host + LM Studio/OpenAI-compat CORS fix, 2183 Tests**

### Critical Fixes (why you want this update)
- **Configurable ComfyUI host** — Settings → ComfyUI → Host. Previously only the port was configurable, the host was hardcoded `localhost`. Now you can point LU at a ComfyUI running in Docker, on a LAN machine, or on a headless homelab server. When the host is local, the Start/Stop/Restart/Install/Path controls stay visible; remote hosts hide them (LU can't manage a remote Python process). Requested in Discussion #1 by @ShoaibSajid.
- **LM Studio (and every OpenAI-compat local backend) can actually be reached from LU** — v2.3.5 auto-detected LM Studio and pre-enabled it, but the actual `/v1/*` calls CORS-failed inside the Tauri WebView because `openai-provider.ts` used plain `fetch()`. Test button always showed "Failed" and models never appeared in the dropdown even when curl confirmed the backend was up. Fix routes localhost calls through the Rust proxy with direct-fetch fallback. Covers LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp server, KoboldCpp, Jan, GPT4All, oobabooga, Aphrodite, SGLang, TGI, LocalAI, TabbyAPI.
- **ComfyUI port now actually persists across restarts** — pre-existing bug: the port setter wrote to `config.json` but startup never read it back. New `load_comfy_config_values()` helper applies persisted port + host at startup.

### What's still in v2.3.6 from v2.3.5
Drop-in upgrade. v2.3.5's auto-detection fix + Windows terminal-popup hardening + setup.bat warnings remain in place. Every fix from v2.3.5, v2.3.4, and earlier still applies.

### Remote Access + Mobile Web App
- **Access your AI from your phone** — Dispatch via LAN or Cloudflare Tunnel (Internet)
- **Full mobile web app** — Hamburger drawer, chat list, Codex mode, file attach, thinking toggle, Plugins (Caveman + Personas)
- **Mobile Agent Mode** — 13 tools with Thought/Action/Observation cards
- **Security hardened** — 6-digit passcodes, rate limiting, JWT auth, permissions enforced, CSP headers

### Codex Coding Agent — Major Upgrade
- **Live streaming** between tool calls — see tokens as they generate
- **Continue capability** — tool-call history persisted, model remembers previous actions
- **AUTONOMY CONTRACT** — model completes ALL steps without premature stopping
- **Fallback answer** — never shows empty bubble after tool calls

### Agent Mode — 13-Phase Rewrite
- **Parallel tool execution** with side-effect grouping
- **Budget system** — max 50 tool calls / 25 iterations per task
- **Sub-agent delegation** — `delegate_task` spawns isolated sub-agents
- **MCP integration** — external tools via ToolRegistry
- **Filesystem awareness** — agent uses file_list/system_info before acting

### New Models + Image Gen
- **Qwen 3.6** (day-0) — 35B MoE, vision + agentic coding + thinking. One-click download
- **ERNIE-Image** (Baidu) — Turbo (8 steps) + Base (50 steps). Plug & play, no custom nodes
- **Image-to-Image** — Upload source, adjust denoise, transform with any model
- **75+ downloadable models** — all URLs verified

### UI/UX
- **AE-style text header** — clean typography for better discoverability
- **Plugins dropdown** — Caveman Mode + Personas in one menu
- **Thinking mode** — tri-state, auto-retry, universal tag stripper
- **2166 tests** — comprehensive smoke tests covering the entire app

## Download

### Windows
Download the installer from [Releases](https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored/releases/latest):
- **`.exe`** — NSIS installer (recommended)
- **`.msi`** — Windows Installer

> **Other platforms:** The source code builds on Linux and macOS via `npm run tauri build`, but only Windows is officially tested and supported.

> **Plug & Play:** Just install and launch. The setup wizard auto-detects all 12 supported local backends ([Ollama](https://ollama.com/), [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), [KoboldCpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), llama.cpp, LocalAI, Jan, GPT4All, text-generation-webui, TabbyAPI, Aphrodite, SGLang). Nothing installed yet? The wizard shows one-click install links for every backend.

## Quick Start

> **New to Locally Uncensored?** Read the [Getting Started Guide](https://locallyuncensored.com/guide/) with screenshots for every step.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored.git
cd locally-uncensored
npm install
npm run dev
```

### For Contributors — Dev-Mode Setup

> ⚠️ **Just want to use the app?** Grab the installer from [Releases](https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored/releases/latest) (the `.exe` or `.msi` in the **Download** section above). That gives you the full Tauri desktop app with auto-update. The commands below start LU in **browser dev-mode** — fewer features, Vite proxy noise, meant for contributing to the codebase.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored.git
cd locally-uncensored
setup.bat   # Windows — installs Node, Git, Ollama, then npm run dev
# setup.sh  # macOS / Linux equivalent
```

Launches at `http://localhost:5173` in your default browser.

### Image & Video Generation

Open the **Create** tab. ComfyUI is auto-detected or one-click installed. Models download with one click. Workflow is set to **Auto** — just write a prompt and hit Generate.
